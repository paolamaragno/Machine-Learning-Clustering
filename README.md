# Machine Learning Clustering task

The aim of this analysis is finding the best clustering algorithm able to cluster the data in a way coherent with their biological characteristics.
The dataset consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex in response to 
learning processes. These proteins expression levels are registered for eight classes of different mice.

The clustering methods present in this work are:
- Hierarchical clustering;
- K-means;
- DBSCAN.
